      "The lighthouse keeper, Silas, was a man woven from the sea itself. His skin was tanned and weathered like driftwood, his eyes the grey-green of a storm-tossed wave. He'd spent thirty years tending the beacon on Gull Island, a lonely sentinel against the relentless Atlantic.\n",
      "\n",
      "Silas wasn't lonely, though. He had the gulls, their cries a constant, familiar chorus. He had the rhythm of the waves, a lullaby that soothed him to sleep. And he had the stories. Stories whispered on the wind, carried in the salt spray, etched into the barnacles clinging to the lighthouse walls.\n",
      "\n",
      "One particularly blustery night, a storm raged with a ferocity Silas hadn't seen in years. The wind howled like a banshee, and the waves crashed against the island, threatening to swallow it whole. Silas, bundled in his oilskins, diligently kept the lamp burning, its beam cutting through the darkness like a sword.\n",
      "\n",
      "Suddenly, amidst the roar of the storm, he heard a faint, desperate cry. It was a sound unlike any he'd heard before, a high-pitched wail that seemed to pierce the very heart of the gale. He strained his ears, peering into the swirling darkness.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then he saw it. A small, wooden crate, tossed about like a toy in the monstrous waves, was heading straight for the jagged rocks at the island's edge. He knew, with a sinking feeling, that whatever was inside wouldn't survive the impact.\n",
      "\n",
      "Without hesitation, Silas grabbed a rope and, bracing himself against the wind, scrambled down the treacherous, wave-swept rocks. The spray stung his face, and the wind threatened to rip him from his precarious perch. But he pressed on, driven by an instinct he couldn't explain.\n",
      "\n",
      "He reached the crate just as it was about to be smashed against the rocks. With a surge of adrenaline, he managed to snag it with the rope and haul it towards him. It was heavier than he expected, and the waves fought him every inch of the way.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, exhausted and soaked to the bone, he dragged the crate back to the lighthouse. He wrestled it inside, his heart pounding in his chest. He pried it open, expecting to find a drowned animal or perhaps some lost cargo.\n",
      "\n",
      "Instead, he found a baby.\n",
      "\n",
      "A tiny, shivering baby, wrapped in a tattered blanket, its face pale and its eyes wide with fear. It was a miracle it was alive.\n",
      "\n",
      "Silas, a man who had lived his life alone with the sea, was suddenly faced with the most vulnerable creature imaginable. He didn't know the first thing about babies. He'd never held one, never changed a diaper, never even considered the possibility of a child in his life.\n",
