## Featured Labs & Coursework

This repository contains the code and notebooks from the labs I have completed.

### 1. Introduction to Function Calling with the Gemini API

* **File**: `intro_function_calling-v2.0.0.ipynb`
* **Description**: This lab explores the powerful function calling feature of the Gemini API. It demonstrates how to define functions within your code and have the Gemini model intelligently call them to retrieve information or interact with external systems, bridging the gap between natural language and structured APIs.

### 2. Getting Started with the Gemini API using cURL

* **File**: `intro_gemini_curl-v2.0.0 (1).ipynb`
* **Description**: This notebook provides a hands-on introduction to interacting with the Gemini API using cURL and REST API calls. It covers fundamental tasks such as text generation, multi-turn chat, multimodal input (text and images), and more, directly from the command line.
